/* TCSS 305 - Tetris Assignment 5
 * Deline Zent (Madeline)
 */

 OVERVIEW:
 I have created a version of the Tetris game with the following classes.
 -Main: Loads the Tetris game
 -TetrisFrame: Stores all the components for the Tetris panel into a frame
 -TetrisPanel: Draws the GUI for the grid and tetris pieces
 -TetrisKeyControls: All the controls for the tetris game
 -ScorePanel: A panel which keeps track of the score and displays it
 -NextPiecePanel: Shows the next piece to fall
 -HelpPanel: A panel to explain key controls for user
 
 TO LOAD:
 To load the Tetris game, please go into the view folder and press on the Main class. This will allow you to reach the 
 main method which loads the game.
 
 ADDITIONAL FILES:
 All linked files and images are in the res folder. This includes all the background music and the tetris squares.
 
 THINGS I COULDN'T FINISH:
 
 1. In TetrisKeyControls, I had a checkstyle error for cyclometic complexity over 10. I kept trying to shorten this,
 I broke it into 2 methods to alleviate it, however whichever statement had an if or a switch would keep this warning.
 I think if I had more time with this project I would've been able to fix this.
 
 2. When the keys are pressed, the game doesn't make a noise along with the key press. I tried everything I could to get
 the sound effects to work but with no avail. I would have been able to finish this had I had more time.
